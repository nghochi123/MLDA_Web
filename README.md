## Prerequisites

### MUST HAVE

- At least a little bit of knowledge on HTML/CSS, as well as how the DOM works

- NodeJS knowledge

## Before the workshop

Before the workshop begins, we will require you to have the following installed/downloaded on your personal computer.

### NodeJS

- NodeJS
- NPM

### Python

In case the requirements.txt file does not work for you, please do install the following packages beforehand. You are strongly recommended to use a virtual environment - I personally use conda but I hear that Venv is pretty good as well.
